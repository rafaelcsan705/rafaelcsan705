# 👋 Hi, I'm Rafael Santos

I have been a programmer since 2018 and throughout my career I have been working as a Mobile Developer in mostly banking applications.
I have always been passionate about applications and my dream has always been to be able to develop them.

My goal is to specialize as iOS Developer because it is what I really like, time flies and I do not rest until I am unable to complete my tasks, achieve my goals.
I am very focused on my professional career because I like great challenges, feeling that I am growing day after day and that is what moves me.
